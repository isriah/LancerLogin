# Coordinator Run State

This file is the durable state for a single active coordinator run. It is updated only by `$lancerlogin-coordinator`; do not implement product work from it.

## Active run

Status: active
Run: 2026-09-03-wu-019-031
Coordinator task: `01a065cb-bd5b-7992-b770-56d5191f4e59`
Mode: complete-all
Execution set: WU-019, WU-020, WU-021, WU-022, WU-023, WU-024, WU-025, WU-026, WU-027, WU-028, WU-029, WU-030, WU-031
Heartbeat: `lancerlogin-coordinator-checkpoints` (active, every five minutes)
Last checkpoint: WU-031 was restored to `ready`. Task inventory had no addressable task or provisioning client for it; `git worktree list --porcelain` had no branch-owned Worktree; and `codex/wu-031-settings-hierarchy-cleanup` had no commit beyond its recorded base `57018bddf9f9a7ded65746c5a886abe841172435`.
Next checkpoint: provision one eligible fixed-set unit from its named branch, beginning with WU-028.
User decision: none
